Set in the Appalachian Mountains, FIDDLIN' is a foot-stomping celebration of true Americana profiling the birthplace of Bluegrass and Old-Time music. This hopeful, inspiring documentary shines a light on what is best about America. Filmed at the World's Oldest Fiddler's Convention, Fiddlin' shows the uplifting and healing power of music. With multi-generations jamming together and kids holding instruments instead of phones, it feels like taking a step back in time as we witness some off-the-charts pickin' and fiddlin'. There is an abundance of raw talent in FIDDLIN', with most talent playing by ear and certainly a number of stars in the making. Wayne Henderson, a world-renowned luthier known as the ""guitar god,"" is a master craftsman and enthralling storyteller. Wayne's friendship with 11-year-old guitar prodigy, Presley Barker, shows how closely knit a community of musicians can be as even mentor and student compete against one another for that coveted blue ribbon. Phenomenal female talents, including Dori Freeman, Martha Spencer, Ivy Phillips and Kitty Amaral are all making their mark. They reveal the difficulties of women breaking into the bluegrass world. Karen Carr describes how music helped her overcome mental illness and saved her life. Sensational flat-foot dancing and some of the last known footage of Doc Watson visiting Wayne Henderson in his guitar shop are but a few topics in this rollicking documentary. Eddie Bond and Jon Lohman share little known history of the music origins and Jake Krack electrifies with his fiddle. These mountain musicians are determined to pass on their music and traditions with most claiming they will ""play till the day they die"". When the top 10 finalists are announced in the ultra-competitive guitar, we're in for an exciting finale. Sister filmmakers, Julie Simone and Vicki Vlasic, returned to their Appalachian roots to film FIDDLIN' at the Old Fiddlers' Convention for the first time in its 80 year history.",https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5618318/?ref_=sr_i_483,,,
